*ngFor is a "structural directive". 
Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to 
which they are attached. Directives with an asterisk, *, are structural directives.

--interpolation syntax {{ }}. -> Interpolation renders a property's value as text.
--property binding [ ] lets you use the property value in a template expression.

--Event binding uses a set of parentheses, ( ), around the event,


Components : 
===================
Components define areas of responsibility in the user interface, or UI, that let you reuse sets of UI functionality.

A component consists of three things:
1.A component class that handles data and functionality. (.ts)
2.An HTML template that determines the UI. (.html)
3.Component-specific styles that define the look and feel. (.css)

An Angular application comprises a tree of components, in which each Angular component has a specific purpose and responsibility.

--@Component() decorator. This indicates that the following class is a component.
It provides metadata about the component, including its selector, templates, and styles.
The selector identifies the component. 
The selector is the name you give the Angular component when it is rendered as an HTML element on the page.
The template and style filenames reference the HTML and CSS files

The component definition also exports the class, ProductAlertsComponent, which handles functionality for the component.
@Input() decorator. The @Input() decorator indicates that the property value passes in from the component's parent,





























1.Angular Framework?
Angular is a typescript based opensorce fornt end platform that makes it easy to build applications in web/mobile/desktop
the major feures of this framework are decalrative templates,dependency injection,end to end testing and more
2. diff bw angialr js and angualr?
 angular is a completely revived component based frameworj in which
an application is tree of individual components

angualr.js
mvc architectire
uses javascript to build apppli
based on controller conceppt
not a mobile friendly framworj
difficult in SEO friendly app develop


Angualr
based on Service/Controller
uses typescrpt
this is a component baed UI aproch
developed considering mobile platform
ease to crate SO friendly application

3.What is typeScript?
is a suerset of jva script created by microsft that adds optional types,classes,async.awai, and many other features and compiler to plain java script
angular built entirely on typescript used as primary langualge
u can install it as globally as
npm install -g typescript

4.Whar key components of angular?
-1.Component: baic building block of app to controll HTML views
-2.Modules: is a set of angular basic building locks like componet,directive,service etc. n application is divided into logical pieces of code is called as module. it performs a single task
-3.Temlates: This respresents the viiews of th anglau application
-4.Routin : defined routing strategy for application
-5.Services: used to created component which can be shared acrross the entore application
-6.Metadata:used to add more data to angular calss

5.What are directives?
Directives add behaviuor to an existing dom element or an exiting component instance
	import {Directive,ElemetRef,Input} from '@angular/Core';
	@Directive({selector:'[myHighlight]'})
	export class highlightDirective{
		cinstructor(el:ElemetRef){
			el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor='yellow';		
			}
	}
	
Now this directive extends HTML element behaviour with a yellow background as yellow
	<p myHighlight>Highlight Me</p>

	maintained by google,
	It has features like declarative templates,dependency Injectin,end to end tooling ..etc that facilitates web app developement
	
Q : How is SPA differs from traditional web technology?
A :

Q : Difference between Components and Directives in Angular ? 
A : Components break up the application into small parts, where as ,   	
	Directives add behaviour to an eisting DOM element.

Q : Can you explain services in Angular?
A : Serive is like a Singleton Object in Angular, Instantiated once contains methods that maintain data through out the life of app,
	Primary intent of it like share business logic ,models or data and functions with various components of an anguar app.
	The func offered  by angular service can be invoked from any angular component, such as a controller or directive
	
Q : How do Observables differ from Promises?
A : Observable : 
	Observable are lazy, means nothing happens untill a subscription is made
	Observable is a stream that allows passing of more than one event,
	A call back is made for each event in observable
	Promises:
	Promises Handles a single event,as soon as the execution takes place.
	
Q : Explain directives in Angular?

	They follow a developer to write new, application specific HTML syntax.
	In actual, directives are funcs that are executed by the angular compiler,
	There are 3 types of drectives..
	1.Attribute directives
	2.Component directives
	3.Structural directives
	
Q : Explain building blocks of Angular?
A : 


Q : Explain data binding , in how many way it can be done?
A : In order to connect applicaion data with the DOM(Data Object Model), data binding used.
	It happens b/w the template(HTML) and component(TypeScript).
	There are 3 ways to achive data binding
	Event binding : Enables the application to respond to user input in the targeted environ
	Property Binding : Enables interpolation of values computed from the application data into the HTML
	Two-way bindning: chnages made in the application state gets automatically reflected in the view and vice versa.
	The ngModel directive is used for achevin this type of data binding
	
Q : What is the use of @input and @output?
A : When it comes to the communication of Angular Components,Which are in Parent-child relationship, 
	we use @input in child component whenever we are passing data from parent to Child Component
	@Output is used in child component to receive an event from child to parent Component.
