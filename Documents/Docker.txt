1.What is Docker?
Dcoker is a tool is designed to make it easier to build,deploy and run application by using containers.

Problem before Docker : 
	Dependency version mismatch from env to another env
	Library corrupted
	Software Upgrade
	
What docker continer do?
	Container allows a developer to package up an application with all the parts it needs such as libraries and
	other dependencies and ship it all as one package.

--Keep jar file Name as : 
	Under build:
	<finalName>DockerSolution</finalName>
Writing Docker File : 
-->In Project Directory -- create file as : DockerFile
Inside Docker File :
FROM openjdk:8
EXPOSE 8080
ADD target/DockerSolution.jar DockerSolution.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/DockerSolution.jar"]


===>

--type command
$docker build -t DockerSolution.jar .

to check docker images:
$docker image ls
