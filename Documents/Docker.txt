Docker:
1.What is Docker?
Dcoker is a tool is designed to make it easier to build,deploy and run application by using containers.

Problem before Docker : 
	Dependency version mismatch from env to another env
	Library corrupted
	Software Upgrade
	
What docker continer do?
	Container allows a developer to package up an application with all the parts it needs such as libraries and
	other dependencies and ship it all as one package.

--Keep jar file Name as : 
	Under build:
	<finalName>DockerSolution</finalName>
Writing Docker File : 
-->In Project Directory -- create file as : DockerFile
Inside Docker File :
FROM openjdk:8
EXPOSE 8080
ADD target/DockerSolution.jar DockerSolution.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/DockerSolution.jar"]


===>
-Open Docker terminal->go to springboot project directory
--type command
$docker build -t DockerSolution.jar .

to check docker images:
$docker image ls
to run docker image
$docker run -p 9090:8080 DockerSolution.jar



//To Check rest end point using docker container port
http://192.168.0.101:9090/message


Docker Commands:

docker run nginx
docker ps --list all containeres and some basic info
docker ps -a -- containeres running status

To stop a container:
docker stop <container ID/Name>

To remove docker image:
docker rm <container ID/Name>

To see list of docker Images and their sizes:
docker images

To Remove Image
docker rmi nginx

//attached mode
docker run kodekcloud/simple-webapp

//detached mode
