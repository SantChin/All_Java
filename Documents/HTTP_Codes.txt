HTTP Status Codes
    When browser requests a service from web server, it will return some status code. I have listed all HTTP Status codes as below,

1xx -  Informational
==========================
100 - Continue - The server has received the request headers, and the client should proceed to send
	  the request body
101 - Switching Protocols -  The Server switches protocol.

2xx - Successful
=========================== 
200 - OK      -  This is a successful HTTP request
201 - Created  -  Request is completed, new resource is created.
202 - Accepted -  The request is accepted for processing, but the processing is not complete.
203 - Non-Authoritative Information -  The information in the entity header is from a local or third-
	  party copy, not from the original server.
204 - No Content  -  A status code and a header are given in the response, but there is no entity-body 
      in the reply.
205 - Reset Content - Browser will clear the form data .
206 - Partial Content - The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent 
                                     by the client

3xx - Redirection

      reserved.

4xx - Client error
===========================
400 - Bad Request - The Request can not be fulfilled because of some bad syntax.
401 - Unauthorized - The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication
      credentials for the target resource.
402 - Payment Required - Now you can not use this code.

      some factor.

413 - Request Entity too large - The server will not accept the request, because the request entity 
      is  too large.
414 -  Request URI too long - The server will not accept the request, because the url is too long. 
       Occurs when you convert a "post" request to a "get" request with a 
       long query information .
415 -  Unsupported Media Type - If media type is not supported, it won't accept the request.
